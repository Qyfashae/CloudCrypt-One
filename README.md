# CloudCrypt-One
This is a project i will be working on for a long time into the future.

"CloudCrypt-One" is just a name that came to my mind. This project is so much more than just a project. 
Hopefully this will help alot of people and also help the cyber security community to maybe learn new things.

CloudCrypt-One is a cyber security platform were you have everything in one dashboard. 

 - Assess, Audit, Evaluate the configurations of your cloud assets
 - IoT/IT Analyzer, Analyze - Behavior, Requests, Responses & Adapts to every attack - Method, Exploit, Dork 
    etc. Also self learning engine(Will be Artificial Intelligence).
 - Tries to learn new 0-day exploits every second, scans the whole IoT after new vulnerabilities. 
 - Vulnerability Management & Orchestration Dashboard.
 - Dependency, Library & SBOM Inventory Scanner.
 - SIEM/OS-C-N-SLP for Threat Hunting, Detection, Response & Cyber Security Analytics on scale(Also AWS).
 - Vulnerability Scanner & Web-Application Scanner.
 - VPS, VPN, DNS-Drip(Protection), MPS, P-Config, S-Config. 
 - Cyber Security/Protection against 99% of Vulnerabilities/Malicous Activity
 - With the help of Artificial Intelligence this can also program/code own scripts that will fix the Vulnerability/Malicous - Activity.

CloudCrypt-One is an amazing project that could potentially revolutionize the cyber security community and help protect countless people from malicious activity.

Will be open-source so every single request, tips, put-in is much appreciated! 
Secure the internet together.
